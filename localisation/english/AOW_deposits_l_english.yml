Due to the special nature of the technology, the pop only needs to use their brainpower to remotely control these facilities, without any physical labor. Therefore, the pop that has undergone special training and transformation will only occupy a small amount of space and can only stay in those huge server units for life. Of course, we allow them to imagine and use whatever they want in their own world."

 AOW_ap.0.name:0"Multi-dimensional Space"
 AOW_ap.0.desc:0"Realizing this beautiful and great vision is not easy, at least not with our current level of technology. Even if we use any material in the Milky Way to build a super megastructure, it will collapse into a black hole because it cannot withstand its own gravity.\n\nHowever, the discovery of subspace, hyperspace, and other spaces that do not belong to this universe, or this dimension, has given us new inspiration. In theory, we can break through the limitations of this dimension and build the fixed devices of these super megastructures in multi-dimensional space. By utilizing the special properties of that space, we can ensure that the super megastructures will not collapse on their own.\n\nNow, it is time to delve into these multi-dimensional spaces and verify whether this theory is feasible. If successful, the benefits of this discovery will be unprecedented."

 AOW_ap.1.name:0"Breaking Through Multi-dimensional Space"
 AOW_ap.1.desc:0"The research department spent a long time looking for a way to enter multi-dimensional space stably, and tried to place building structures across dimensions many times, but most of them ended in failure. However, scientists finally found a substance in the materials we discovered that can help us enter multi-dimensional space stably - §YThe Dark Matter§!.\n\nDuring this exploration process, we unexpectedly discovered that the potential of the unique substance’s twisted spacetime curvature can be used to open up stable wormhole connections to enter multi-dimensional space. In addition, economists predict that our demand for dark matter may increase sharply in the coming era.\n\nThe research department also developed a brand new megastructure, which is not large enough to span galaxies, but uses the latest theoretical achievements. They suggested that we use this megastructure for the initial experiment."

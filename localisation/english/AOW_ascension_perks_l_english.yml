 ap_era_of_deterrence_desc:0"As the deterrence theory becomes more popular in our country, some ideas of gigantic weapons that could overturn our cognition have been proposed. They are considered to be the strongest deterrence force in this galaxy. Since we have achieved a leap in the technology of building megastructures, why not integrate it with military technology to achieve a leap in military power?"

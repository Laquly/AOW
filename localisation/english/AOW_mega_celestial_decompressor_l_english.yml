 AOW_TECH_celestial_decompressor:0"$AOW_MEGA_celestial_decompressor$"
 AOW_TECH_celestial_decompressor_desc:0"Extreme gravitational celestial bodies such as black holes and neutron stars seem to be irreversible as the final destination of star evolution. However, with our research on the structure and changes of spacetime, the gravitational field can be counteracted by reversing the curvature of spacetime to revive these stellar remains."

 AOW_evt_celestial_decompressor.100.desc:0"Once we thought that stars were eternal, that they would not be destroyed, nor would they move, and they would always remain in a fixed position in the sky. However, as our understanding of the universe deepens, we realize that stars are not eternal. They move at a fairly fast speed and have their own heroic funerals. If left unattended, when all the stars in the universe die, our universe will be plunged into endless darkness.\n\nFortunately, with our sufficient knowledge of spacetime structures and various stars, we can attempt an almost impossible fantasy, which is to reverse the death of stars and reverse the remains of stars into young main-sequence stars.\n\nWe give stars life; stars give the universe light."
 AOW_evt_celestial_decompressor.100.a:0"Give the future light."
 AOW_evt_celestial_decompressor.101.desc:0"With the support of vast resources, the construction of the megastructure named $AOW_MEGA_celestial_decompressor$ has been completed.\n\nThese six axial tensor contravariant field generators will produce a huge gravitational contravariant field by loading a small black hole, forcibly “propping up” spacetime by reversing spacetime curvature, releasing matter trapped in a strong gravitational field, causing celestial bodies to undergo anomalous expansion and become young stars again."
 AOW_evt_celestial_decompressor.101.a:0"Ready to embrace change…"
 AOW_evt_celestial_decompressor.102.desc:0"The small black hole is loaded and slowly generates a gravitational contravariant field. Although the celestial bodies that could originally produce neutron stars or even black holes must be massive stars that exceed the white dwarf mass limit, the waste caused by the supernova explosion and reverse restoration of the original celestial body has led to the fact that the star produced by the $AOW_MEGA_celestial_decompressor$ can only be a yellow dwarf star (ordinary Class G star) at most.\n\nAfter the reverse restoration is completed, a violent supernova explosion will occur here, and the $AOW_MEGA_celestial_decompressor$ will bear and isolate the full power of this supernova explosion, which will destroy this huge artificial structure."
 AOW_evt_celestial_decompressor.102.a:0"Let’s start reversing the future."
 AOW_evt_celestial_decompressor.103.desc:0"A small-scale supernova occurred in [from.GetName], and its light will illuminate the entire galaxy in hundreds of thousands of years to declare the miracle we have created. Revealed by this supernova is a small mass star that has been reversed from a strong gravitational celestial body, illuminating the dead space of [from.GetName] again."

 AOW_evt_celestial_decompressor.300.a:0"Keep monitoring"
 AOW_evt_celestial_decompressor.301.desc:0"According to numerous tachyon messages, a strong gravitational celestial body in [fromfrom.GetName] underwent anomalous expansion, causing the place that was originally a dense celestial body to become a young G-type star again. This impossible celestial activity must have been caused by human intervention, and there is reason to suspect that [from.GetName] has revived a star through some kind of megastructure."

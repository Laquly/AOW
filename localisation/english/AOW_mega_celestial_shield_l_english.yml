 AOW_evt_celestial_shield.100.desc:0"In order to resist potential dense threats, and to prevent our cause from being destroyed at once, we have specially built a central device for coordinating the national defense system, which can assist us in building a defense structure with strategic depth.\n\nNot only that, in order to counter long-range system strikes, we have specially prepared the Bunker Ring plan. They are considered to be the only defense against the $AOW_MEGA_starfall_spear$ at present. With it, we no longer have to worry about sudden interstellar strikes."
 AOW_evt_celestial_shield.100.a:0"A very good defense megastructure."
 AOW_evt_celestial_shield.101.desc:0"The force field constraint ring, which can concentrate stellar energy and prevent celestial activities from damaging the $AOW_MEGA_starfall_spear$, is the first necessary component to be built."

Even if we replenish the number of Bunker Rings within the next 30 days, we still cannot block the attack. Therefore, we need to always pay attention to the enemy’s intentions and replenish all the Bunker Rings."
